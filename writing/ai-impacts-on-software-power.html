                <p>Persistent differential returns are driven by power. Power comes in seven forms:</p>

                <p>For anyone familiar with Hamilton Helmer, this will sound familiar. His "seven powers" has become a popular starting point for analyzing profitability. In this piece, I aim to analyze the powers of software businesses and how I think they will be impacted by AI. I'll briefly summarize the definition of each power, but for anyone not familiar with them, I recommend <a href="https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/7-powers-with-hamilton-helmer">Acquired's interview with Hamilton Helmer</a>.</p>

                <h2>Scale Economies</h2>

                <p>Scale economies occur when per unit costs decrease with volume. This is a core power of all software businesses. The high fixed cost of building the software can be amortized across many customers at basically zero marginal cost. It is inefficient for each company to build their own version of software systems that are similar across companies, in the same way that it is inefficient for companies to generate their own electricity, design their furniture, or manufacture their own merchandise.</p>

                <p>AI has obvious impacts on the scale economies of SaaS. The cost of creating code has gone down tremendously. How does this impact the potential for persistent, differential returns in software businesses? Scale economies protect profits in proportion to the upfront cost. Other players looking to compete with scale would need to be unprofitable in order to catch up. To be unprofitable, they need access to external capital. Access to external capital requires promise of a risk-adjusted return. If there is an outsized risk-adjusted return to be had, capital and competition will enter the market. This will push down prices until the outsized return has been competed away. Therefore, if only scale economies are taken into account, an existing piece of software should generate returns in proportion to the upfront cost of recreating it today.</p>

                <p>This conclusion is devastating for software companies relying primarily on scale economies for profits. The reduction in the cost of creating software depends on the specifics, but it's easy to argue a 10x decrease. It might be 100x within a year or two. Earnings should decrease proportionally. To asses the impact on a specific business, imagine that all their existing code became open source. The impact on Meta or Netflix would be zero or close to zero. It is all about the content. For a website builder, open source code would erode almost all profits. Clones would emerge and compete away all margins. We won't reach the zero-cost-of-code limit, but if software profits survive that hypothetical, they will survive in a future with a low cost of code as well.</p>

                <h2>Network Economies</h2>

                <p>Network economies exist when the value of the product increases as other people use it. Social media is the classic example. People join the same network as people they know. In software there are also examples of network economies. Slack becomes more useful as others join, both internally and externally. Salesforce integrates with everything, incentivizing both adaption and further integrations. Snowflake's instant sharing feature reduces the cost of data collaboration between customers.</p>

                <p>AI coding tools won't impact networks of people or companies. For software application networks, coding tools will change the dynamics. Cheaper code means lower cost for an application developer support additional networks. This equates to reducing the cost of multi-homing in Hamilton's nomenclature. Lower cost of multi-homing limits the profits that can be extracted. Compare Uber to Windows. The cost of checking Lyft is much lower than the cost of porting a software application to a new operating system. Consequently, Microsoft was able to extract far greater profits than Uber. With AI coding tools, software application networks (e.g. Salesforce's AppExchange or Windows itself) are becoming more like Uber and less like Windows.</p>

                <p>There is a likely world in which agents are the primary producers and consumers of digital information. In this world, if one can find a way to impose multi-homing costs on agents, I anticipate that applications where agentic usage increase the value for other agents could be some of the largest success stories in the coming decades. This will be rare though; agents are infinitely patient and rational. If few companies control the agent layer and dictate their default traffic (like Microsoft could dictate search traffic when they controlled the browser), agents could also switch network en-masse if a better alternative arises. However, if an agent company took such action to move traffic into a network they controlled, anti-trust lawsuits likely follow.</p>

                <p>Aggregators (e.g. OpenTable or Expedia) are also powerful because of network economies. They have consumer mindshare and producers therefore participate. If agents are the new way consumers interface with information, an aggregator will need agent mindshare instead. What it takes to gain agent mindshare is largely a function of how many agent providers are out there. If a single company dominates, independent aggregators will have very little leverage. Today, Booking makes almost no profit when somebody visits their website through Google. Dollars flow into their pockets only when people browse the site directly. Will anyone browse sites directly when browsers are replaced by agents? Will there be any power left for independent aggregators?</p>

                <p>The same dynamics that led a single player to dominate search exist for chat. Advertising is valuable in proportion to users. Users are valuable in proportion to the amount of advertising. Mutual reinforcement and aggressive traffic acquisition spend leads to one player running away with the market. This is bad news for independent aggregators that depend on consumer mindshare and direct browsing of their applications.</p>

                <h2>Switching Costs</h2>

                <p>SaaS has a wide range of switching costs. Switching costs capture the productivity lost when switching from one tool to another. Familiarity is almost always there as a switching cost. Even if it takes 15 clicks and two emails to file an expense in the current system, it is initially easier than a two step process that is completely unfamiliar. A second kind of switching cost is engineering. Moving from one cloud provider to another takes a lot of engineering effort. Switching database providers, observability platforms, or experimentation frameworks also come with engineering costs. A third form of switching cost is risk. Some services are so mission-critical that even a small chance of something going wrong is unacceptable. Many banks are famously still running Fortran. IBM reports that 71% of Fortune 500 companies still use mainframes in their operations. This is partly due to engineering costs, but also due to how much revenue and reputation depend on the flawless operations of these systems. A fourth form of switching costs are actual dollars. Moving large volumes of data often comes with an egress cost and can be prohibitively expensive.</p>

                <p>The impact of AI on switching costs is highly heterogeneous. AI enables new products to have more intuitive interfaces and more powerful features. This lowers the learning curve for getting familiar and increases the reward once familiarity has been achieved. For engineering switching costs, AI will help significantly. AI coding tools excel at these highly structured migration tasks. For risk, AI will also have an impact, although smaller than for familiarity and engineering. AI can reduce risks and increase rewards but my bet would be that the impact on the decision making of risk-averse incumbents will be negligible. When the switching cost is actual dollars, like the cost of moving data, I don't see AI having a significant impact either.</p>

                <h2>Counter Positioning</h2>

                <p>Counter positioning occurs when new companies adapt business models that incumbents won't copy because it would hurt their existing business. It must make sense to invest in something as a startup, but at the same time not make sense when you have existing cash flows. ChatGPT is a recent example. Despite having the critical innovations, it didn't make sense for Google to cannibalize their sponsored search links with free-from chat.</p>

                <p>With a lower cost of software, new, lower-margin business models can start making sense. Marketplaces that take a cut of each transaction will probably be challenged by ones with a fixed cost to participation; per-seat is already being challenged by consumption models.</p>

                <p>Custom software will start to make sense at smaller scale. Google already builds all their systems in-house. It makes sense both because they can amortize across their scale and because of their bespoke challenges. It will always be more efficient to share a common system, but all companies have slightly different needs. With AI, the value of filling one's bespoke needs stays constant, but the cost of doing so drops. Companies will transition from shared platforms to in-house systems in proportion to the gains that are to be had from customization. This is an important point; it will still be cheaper to share a system, even if the provider makes a profit, than rebuilding in-house. The saved dollars won't be enough to motivate in-housing; only when gains from increased control are taken into account will the decision to in-house start making sense.</p>

                <h2>Cornered Resources</h2>

                <p>A cornered resource is defined by Hamilton as "access on attractive terms to an asset that can independently increase value". I don't know if there is much to say about cornered resources and software. Cornered resources are things like mining rights or patents. They are a reliable path to profits, but seldom exist in software.</p>

                <h2>Branding</h2>

                <p>Branding power is defined as a "durable attribution of value to an objectively identical offering due to historical information about the seller". Some software companies have managed to create this, but it's not a core power of software.</p>

                <p>AI is already becoming part of branding. While it might increase valuations marginally in the short term, simply branding oneself as AI is unlikely to produce differential returns over the long term. AI will become ubiquitous.</p>

                <p>It's unclear what the impact of AI on software brands will be. Companies that fail to integrate AI might come to be seen as outdated. Or an avalanche of slop might place a premium on old school deterministic systems. Branding has too much uncertainty to make predictions.</p>

                <h2>Process Power</h2>

                <p>Process power is a set of practices and activities that enable lower costs and/or superior products. The key thing that makes it a power is that it takes time and effort to copy. Software companies have a lot of processes. How do multiple people iterate quickly on a complex system while keeping several nines of reliability? How is feedback from users surfaced, triaged, and integrated into the product?</p>

                <p>How does the rise of AI impact process power? AI has the potential to improve or eliminate many processes. At an established company, processes can be hard to alter. Many minds have to align even for minute changes. Companies with a culture of constantly questioning and trying new things will be faster at making their processes AI native.</p>

                <p>Part of establishing process power is identifying problems in need of processes. This favors incumbents. While a challenger might have higher speed, an incumbent can make up for it with better direction.</p>

                <p>AI enables the creation of new, more powerful processes, but also benefits from organizational knowledge about important problems. On net, the value of existing process power decreases. AI gives challengers an ability to leapfrog incumbent processes. The extent to which leapfrogging is possible depends on how much AI is impacting the field in question.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p>To think clearly about the impact of AI, it helps to start from power. Power breaks down the concept of a "moat" into a more nuanced set of attributes. The impact of AI on software power is very heterogenous. Scale economies are likely to take a large hit. Application networks will see a lower cost of multi-homing from AI coding tools. Networks of people or companies might see a significant hit when agents become primary interface for information. But AI is not reducing the cost of multi-homing petabytes of data. Lower engineering costs and more powerful, intuitive products will entice companies to replace their current tools. We are already seeing AI challengers in surveys (Listen), compliance (Delve), and recruiting (JuiceBox), just to mention a few.</p>

                <p>While I've talked a lot about specific companies, products, and predictions, the point I'm really trying to make is to take a step back and think about what is actually driving profits in software. Instead of indiscriminately selling software because AI can generate code, one should first determine the impacts cheaper code on the powers that enable a particular software business to generate persistent differential returns.</p>
